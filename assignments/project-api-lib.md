# Project: API Library

## Description 
Your goal is write a library that makes using a web API easier to use. 

The code you write should be usable in any project that might make use of the chosen web API. This means that your code should not include things like API keys, instead it should receive these options from out side.

Here is a list of web APIs that you could build a library around: 

- [Yoda Speak](https://rapidapi.com/ismaelc/api/yoda-speak)
- [AccuWeather](https://rapidapi.com/stefan.skliarov/api/AccuWeather)
- [Hearthstone](https://rapidapi.com/omgvamp/api/hearthstone)
- [Breaking News](https://rapidapi.com/MyAllies/api/breaking-news)
- [Natural Language Nutritional Analysis](https://rapidapi.com/edamam/api/edamam-nutrition-analysis)
- [Measure the Happiness of large populations](https://rapidapi.com/andyreagan/api/hedonometer)
- [Sentiment Analysis](https://rapidapi.com/peckjon/api/algorithmia-nlp-sentimentanalysis)

Your goal is to simplify using your chosen API. This can be done in a few ways. Use any or all of the ideas below, or come up with your own ideas.

The Browser has many built in APIs. You have probably use a few these already. You can write a library for one of these if you like: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

## Test app
Your submitted homework should inlcude a test app that shows your code in action. The test should import your code to a react Project with npm. Your test app does not have to be complex, the goal is to show your library functioning in context, not creating complex comercial project.
